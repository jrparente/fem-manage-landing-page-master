## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- [A11y Slider](https://a11yslider.js.org/)

### What I learned

My favourite parts of this challenge was creating the responsive menu, and the javascript horizontal slider. The menu was created and coded 100% by me. For the slider I used a javacript library referenced above. It was my first time using a JS library ad it was very good learning.

### Continued development

I feel like my biggest challenge was placing the SVG images in the background. I managed to do t, but it looks different from the original design files. I am going to keep trying to work with SVGs in order to perfect these techniques.
